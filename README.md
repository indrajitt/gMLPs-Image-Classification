## CS F425 Project: gMLPs for Image Classification

This repo is a part of my final project submission for the course "Deep Learning" conducted at BITS Goa. This project is based on the the paper [Pay Attetnion to MLPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08050v2). The paper suggests a simple MLP(with gating) based architecture as an alternative to Vision Transformers for Image Classification tasks. The comparisons performed in the notebook suggest that self-attention is not critical for Vision-Transformers as gMLP can achieve a similar accuracy.
